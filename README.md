# NETWHAT?

This is one of the first projects in the 42 coding school, it's an introduction to network problematics, and it's basically a multiple choice quiz that evaluates students' knowledge on networking.

You will find in this repository:

- The notes I've taken while preparing for this project. They cover most of the basic information needed for the test.
- The subject file for more information about the test.
